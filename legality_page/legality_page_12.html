                         <P>Yes, it is absolutely safe! <strong>Anim11</strong> is a game of “skill”. The relevant law in India is absolutely clear that, unlike games of "chance", games which substantially require a player to apply his skill are absolutely legal.</P>
                         <P>All games hosted by <strong>Anim11</strong> are carefully designed and the jurisdiction of prize winners is strictly monitored to ensure legal compliance with relevant laws currently in force in India.
                        </P>
                        <P>If you are accessing this site from Assam, Orissa, Telangana, Sikkim or Nagaland you will be prohibited from playing cash contests on <strong>Anim11</strong> from any of these five states. As the law in these five states is unclear on playing games of skill for cash prizes.</P>
